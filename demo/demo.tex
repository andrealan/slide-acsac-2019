\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Context}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Cross-device communications allow nearby devices to directly
    communicate bypassing cellular base stations (BSs) or access
    points (APs) (e.g. {\bf spectral efficiency improvement, energy
      saving, and delay reduction}, etc.)

  \item Without the need for infrastructure, {\bf such a technology
      enables mobile users (e.g., Android) to instantly share
      information (e.g., pictures and videos)}

  \item Such technology is also predominat in {\bf IoT environment}
    where a mobile device is direct connected to the embedded system.

   \end{itemize}


  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Current Solutions}
  \begin{itemize}

  \item Several solutions exist for securing cross-device
    communication.  In the Android environment, they allow
    {\bf authentication of devices and communication channels}.

  \item Others solutions {\bf restricts appsâ€™ access to external
      resources, such as Bluetooth, SMS and NFC}, by defining new
    SEAndroid types to represent the resources.

  \item Moroever such {\bf solutions are not able to address several
      communication channels such as: SMS, Audio, Wi-Fi and NFC} due
    to of missing important information for the detection purpose.

  \end{itemize} 

  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Contributions}


 \begin{itemize}
  
 %\item This problem is due to the fact that the authentication between
 %  apps is missing. {\bf We name this security issue cross-device
 %    app-to-app communication hijacking, or CATCH}.

 \item We identify a security problem called {\bf cross-device
     app-to-app communication hijacking (CATCH)}, which commonly
   exists in Android apps that use short-distance channels, and
   afflicts all the tested Android version.

 \item We provide a solution to the CATCH problem by {\bf designing
     and developing an authentication scheme detector} that analyzes
   Android apps to discover potential vulnerabilities

 \item {\bf Validate the results of our system on Android apps} with
   manual analysis, and test its resilience in detecting the
   authentication scheme.

\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}


\section{Cross Device Authentication Scheme}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Cross-device Authentication Scheme}

  %\begin{itemize}

  %\item Currently, most cross-device, peer-to-peer communications
  %  channels are authenticated by using an {\bf out-of-band scheme}.

  %\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Threat Model \& Attack}

  \begin{itemize}


  \item The attacker is able to install a malicious app on the
    mobile's victim phone.

  \item The malicious app can therefore craft custom messages to send
    to the other device, which are displayed as if they were sent from
    the original app.

  \item Depending on the particular context, there are some scenarios
    in which the attack can become very dangerous: {\bf Phishing,
      Malware delivery, Exploitation}.

  \end{itemize}

  
\end{frame}

\section{Approach Overview}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Challenges}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item We need to define a {\bf generic scheme that captures the es-
      sential logic of app-to-app authentication}.

  \item We need to define a strategy for differentiating between an
    if-statement that does not operate on security critical data and
    an {\bf if-statement that is a part of the authentication scheme}.

  \item Additionally, the authentication scheme {\bf can be
      implemented in several ways according to the developer
      experience}. This adds an additional layer of difficulty for our
      analysis.

  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Authentication Scheme Definitions}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item We define a {\bf communication} in our model as some exchange
    of data from A1 to A2, beginning when A2 reads the data from the
    communication channel.

  \item We define a {\bf use} of the data as any operation whose
    result depends on the data itself.

  \item We define an {\bf authenticated use of the data} as any
    instruction that needs to be authenticated before access to the
    data.
      
  \end{itemize}

  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Detection Strategy}

  We define two main check points for our algorithm:
  \begin{itemize}

  \item An {\bf entry point} is an instruction in the code that
      indicates the start of the communication over the analyzed
      channel (e.g., data receiving)

    \item An {\bf exit point} is represented by the first
      authenticated use of the data coming from the monitored channel.

   \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\section{Technical Details}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Technical Details} 

\begin{itemize}

\item Our system is composed of three main components: (1) {\bf Graphs
  Builder}, (2) {\bf Path Finder} and (3) {\bf App-to-app Authentication
  Finder}. 

\item (1) builds an inter-component control flow graph {\bf (ICFG)}
  and intercomponent data flow graph of the whole app. Finally, the
  framework builds a data dependency graph (DDG) on top the {\bf
    IDFG}.

\item (2) The Path Finder component traverses the CFG received from
  Graphs Builder, and {\bf marks entry points for the analyzed channel}
  based on a predefined list of method signatures.
 
\item (3) App-to-app Authentication Finder applies {\bf further
    checks} to the paths received from Path Finder, in order {\bf to
    exclude false positive} results by recognizing checks against
  constant values.
